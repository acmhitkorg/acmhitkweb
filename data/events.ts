  Bhattacharya Abstract: What is the chance that among a group of friends, at least
  2 of them have the same birthday? This is the celebrated birthday problem, which
  connects many seemingly disparate problems both within and beyond
  mathematics. In this talk, we will discuss different variations of the birthday
  paradox and their applications in computer science, specifically distributional
  property testing and computation of discrete logarithms. (ii)"God Forever
  Geometrizes" by Dr. Bhargab B. Bhattacharya Abstract: As Plato observed, nature
  is governed by the eternal laws of geometry. In this talk, we show some
  fascinating examples to demonstrate how geometry manifests in physics and in
  ancient architectures. Next, from the perspective of computational geometry, we
  demystify the problem of cutting a pizza or a sandwich. Finally, we demonstrate
  how 2D point-set polygonization yields assistance to differently-abled persons.`,

Join us in this informative and hands-on session as we demystify the world of RS and learn how these digital fairy godmothers work their magic to enhance user experiences. In the first part of our talk, we'll dive deep into the world of Recommender Systems, shedding light on their applications, workings, and various types. You'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the foundations of RS, setting the stage for your journey into the world of personalized recommendations. In the second part, get ready to put your knowledge to the test as we guide you through the process of building a simple RS model. We'll use a user-friendly framework, making it accessible to everyone. We'll share practical tips and best practices to help you fine-tune your RS and ensure it provides meaningful recommendations. Join us for this exciting journey into the world of Recommender Systems, and discover how they can be your own fairy godmother of choices, making every digital interaction feel like it was designed just for you.",

        description: `We will present a very simple streaming algorithm on F_0 estimation
  that also caught the eye of Donald E. Knuth. In a recent article, Donald E. Knuth
  started with the following two paragraphs: "Sourav Chakraborty, N. V.
  Vinodchandran, and Kuldeep S. Meel have recently proposed an interesting
  algorithm for the following problem: A stream of elements (a1, a2,..., am) is
  input, one at a time, and we want to know how many of them are distinct. In
  other words, if A = {a1, a2,..., am} is the set of elements in the stream, with
  multiplicities ignored, we want to know |A|, the size of that set. But we don?t
  have much memory; in fact, |A| is probably a lot larger than the number of
  elements that we can hold in memory at any one time. What is a good strategy for
  computing an unbiased estimate of |A|? Their algorithm is not only interesting, it
  is extremely simple. Furthermore, it?s wonderfully suited to teaching students
  who are learning the basics of computer science. (Indeed, ever since I saw it, a
  few days ago, I?ve been unable to resist trying to explain the ideas to just about
  everybody I meet.) Therefore I?m pretty sure that something like this will
  eventually become a standard textbook topic. This note is an initial
  approximation to what I might write about it if I were preparing a textbook about
  data streams."`,
